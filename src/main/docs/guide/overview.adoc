The next image illustrates the behavior of Android app version 1. The Android app is composed by two Activities.

* When the Android application initial screen loads, it requests an announcements list.
* The Grails app sends a JSON payload which includes a list of announcements. For each announcement, a unique identifier, a title and a HTML body are included.
* The android app renders the JSON Payload in a ListView.
* The user taps an announcement's title and the app transition to a detail screen. The initial screen sends the
detail screen the announcement identifier, title and HTML body. The latter will be rendered in a WebView.
